# Menu

Our team is heavily inspired by good flavors, wherever in the world. Some are traditional, family recipes that remind us home. Others are the mouthwatering results of experimentation with leftover ingredients. If it tastes good and we think people want it, then it’s here.

Because there is so much amazing food out there, we have more menu items that you may not find on this page. Or if you have a specific vision for the food at your event, reach out and ask us. Our crew has some of Humboldt’s best chefs, and we’ll do everything we can to make your dream a reality.
